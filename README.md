# Leesmap
## In development, do not use!
Experimental IndieWeb-Reader with a graph-database backend.

See [my post about it](https://seblog.nl/2018/10/22/13/three-things-about-readers) that I wrote after IndieWebCamp NÃ¼rnberg 2018.

## What does the name 'Leesmap' mean?

My first attempt to build a Reader was called 'Lees', the imperative form of the Dutch verb 'lezen', which means 'to read'. This project is just a backend, which is more about collecting posts than reading them.

The Dutch word 'leesmap' stands for a subscription on multiple magazines, often used by doctors or hairdressers to put in their waiting room. I thought it was a nice name, for the English word 'map' can also refer to the graph of posts which this backend uses.
